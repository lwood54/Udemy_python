##########################
SETTING UP GIT HUB
##########################
1. setup account at github.com

2. make sure git is installed
  >>> git --version

3. create new directory where projects will go

4. copy and paste one of the projects we have worked on
  (I'm using Django_Level_Five_My)

5. paste the project into the new directory, ex. my_projects

6. here are the instructions at github.com's site to add new project
echo "# django-deployment-example" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/lwood54/django-deployment-example.git
git push -u origin master

7. Jose says for first project, don't worry about README.md
so..
  >>>git init
  >>>git add .  (this basically means git add everything)
                (I assume that means "everything" in the directory
                that we are currently in.)
  >>>git commit . -m 'first'
  >>>git remote add origin https://github.com/lwood54/django-deployment-example.git
      (copy and paste from instructions on github.com when adding a repo)
  >>>git push -u origin master


##########################
UPDATING PROJECT AND Pushing back to Github
##########################
1. checkout whatever branch you are working on, like master
2. make changes and save files
3. command line:
  >>>git add .    (adds all changes and files at once,
                  you can individually specify if you want to,
                  but there are other instrutions that will need
                  to be looked up.)
  >>>git commit -m "type clear message here"
  >>>git push origin master
